Description:
    Creates a generated set of controllers and a model to support logging in.

Example:
    rails generate simple_auth:setup user

    This will create:
        app/models/user.rb

    and many other files, including specs and a migration.
    
    Options:
      --skip-specs 
        Doesn't generate specs for the generated code
    
      --skip-migration
        Doesn't add a migration. If you use this you'll want to add
        username, email, password, and password_digest fields to your database.
